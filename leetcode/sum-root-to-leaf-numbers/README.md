
Given a binary tree containing digits from0-9only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path1->2->3which represents the number123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

For example,

    1
   / \
  2   3

The root-to-leaf path1->2represents the number12.
The root-to-leaf path1->3represents the number13.

Return the sum = 12 + 13 =25.
